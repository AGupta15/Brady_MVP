A statistical deep dive on Tom Brady's 2017 NFL Season. To perform our analysis, we used the nflscrapR [dataset](https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data).

The dataset can also be found in our repo (pbp_2017_wp.csv). The datapreprocessing we completed can be found in Data/, where each graph's dataset can be found in corresponding csv files. The content of our article can be found at index.html
