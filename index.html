  <p id="para">Every NFL regular season, teams fight through a 16 game slate
    which pits them against rivals across the league. The length of the season
    provides a large sample to truly distinguish the bad, good, and great teams.
    Yet it is always difficult to recognize who is most responsible for their
    team’s success. The NFL anoints a “Most Valuable Player” at the end of each
    season to honor the player who is perceived to have contributed the most to
    his team. In 2017, the New England Patriots finished with a league best 13-3
    record, and their Quarterback, Tom Brady, was
    <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2757545-nfl-mvp-2017-18-award-winner-voting-results-and-twitter-reaction"
    >awarded</a>
    the MVP honor. The MVP award is voted on by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award#Associated_Press_NFL_MVP_award"
    target="_blank">members of the media</a>. However, these members are subject
    to biases and each members vote may influenced by personal opinion, group think
    and player exposure due to the market they play in (consider a player in a
    big-time city like New York vs in Kansas City). Throughout the season, many
    players emerged as candidates for the MVP when their teams entered hot streaks
    emphasizing the fact that the team might be the more responsible for the award
    versus the player themselves. Thus, we pose the question: Did Tom Brady
    deserve the 2017 NFL MVP?

  </p>
  <p id="para">
    To answer this question, we aim to define metrics that analyze a player’s
    contribution to his team and use our metrics to statistically break down a
    set of quarterbacks who we consider MVP candidates in the 2017 NFL Season.
    It is important to note that in our methodology, we selected metrics for
    analysis <i>before</i> looking at the dataset to reduce any biases we may exhibit.
    Furthermore, we make this analysis available to you, the reader, such that
    you can perform your own analysis. In each section, we will explain our
    methodology, including how we processed the data. For those who are not as
    familiar with football but are fans of numerical arguments, we will provide
    notes like this

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="This is an example info button"/>
    </svg>

    to supplement
    your knowledge of football as you read this analysis.
  </br></br>
  </p>

  <h1 id="h1-section">MVP Candidates</h1></br>
  <p id="para"> We picked our set of NFL MVP candidates to only include
    quarterbacks (QBs). This is because QBs inherently have more value in
    today’s NFL as passing has taken over offensive play calling

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="An in-depth Data Visualization post on how NFL offenses have changed
      <a href='https://www.besttickets.com/blog/evolution-of-nfl-offense/'
      target='_blank'>over time</a>"/>
    </svg>

    .
    Quarterbacks touch the ball on every play and make the most important
    decisions that influence his team’s success, such as audibles

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="An audible is when the QB changes the play the offense will run.</br>
      This may be because there are better matchups for the offense </br> based on how
      the defense is aligned."/>
    </svg>

    , checking the
    defense and modifying the play

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="More in depth than an audible, a QB may change the responsibility </br>
      of a specific player on the field without changing the play."/>
    </svg>

    , and getting the ball from the center to the
    running back or receiver

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="At the start of every play, the ball is snapped </br>
      from the center to the QB. The QB is responsible </br> for
      either handing the ball to the running back, </br>
      or throwing it to a receiver."/>
    </svg>

    . Furthermore, 22.5 of the last 30 MVP Awards have
    gone to QBs (0.5 being attributed to Co-MVPs). Although those who were fans
    of Todd Gurley of the LA Rams may contest this statement

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="Todd Gurley is a Running Back for the Los Angeles</br> Rams.
      Gurley also received votes for the MVP in 2017."/>
    </svg>

    , in order to
    complete a fair assessment of Brady, we will compare him against only
    quarterbacks, as these players have metrics relevant to Brady. Our NFL
    MVP candidate set includes 6 QBs who were selected for the 2018 Pro Bowl, the NFL
    all star game. This game is voted on by fans, but on aggregate covers players who performed
    the best that season. Here, all QBs that received votes for the MVP awards are in our MVP candidate set.


  </br></br>
  1. Tom Brady, NE</br>
  2. Carson Wentz, PHI</br>
  3. Roethlisberger, PIT</br>
  4. Philip Rivers, LAC</br>
  5. Russell Wilson, SEA</br>
  6. Drew Brees, NO</br>
</br>

<h1 id="h1-section">Metrics of Analysis</h1></br>
We will compare Brady to each of the other 11 QBs and gauge his value on 3 metrics:</br></br>
<b>1. Effectiveness</b></br>
We gauge effectiveness by looking at how successful a QB is at passing the ball
downfield. This dimension analyzes QB accuracy by looking at completion percentage.
We look at effectiveness by pass distance, accuracy by down

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Each team must advance the ball 10 yards from their </br>
  starting point within 4 tries to keep the ball. Each of</br>
   these tries is called a down."/>
</svg>

, and accuracy
by point spread in the game. Each of these graphs highlight the QB’s
effectiveness based on pass difficulty (distance), short-term difficulty (down),
and long-term difficulty and pressure (point spread).</br></br>

<b>2. Efficiency</b></br>
Our efficiency analysis looks at a QB based on a series of metrics
including time per possession

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Time per possession highlights the amount of time </br>
   a team has the ball when they are on offense."/>
</svg>

, yards per drive

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Yards per drive tells us how much distance a team </br>
   progresses on each possession"/>
</svg>

, points per drive

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="The name of the game is to score. Points per </br>
  drive tells us how much a team scores."/>
</svg>

, and
plays per drive

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Plays per drive tells us how many tries </br>
  the team has to move the ball towards the goal."/>
</svg>

. This evaluates a QB on the quality of the drives

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="A drive is a series of plays (tries) that results in a </br>
  team either scoring or giving the ball to the other team."/>
</svg>

 they play in
by looking at speed of scoring, length, and rate of progress.</br></br>

<b>3. Impact</b></br>
We look for player value by looking at his impact on his team’s win
percentage probability

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Win probability is computed by the models at nflscrapR-data."/>
</svg>

, utilizing a slope graph. By comparing offense
and defense win probability, the slope from defense to offense will indicate how
much that given player impacts their team.</br></br>

<h1 id="h1-section">Methodology</h1></br>
To compute our analysis metrics, we rely on the
<a href="https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data" target="_blank">nflscrapR-data</a> dataset,
which contains a play by play documentation across the 2017 NFL Season.
The author originally scraped all the data from the
<a href="https://api.nfl.com/docs/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">NFL API</a>
and joined many datasets together to form this one.</br></br>

We filter the quarterbacks we compare in our visualizations QBs by the number of
pass attempts they have across the 2017 NFL Season. We include a QB if they have
attempted at least 100 passes, as this provides a reasonable body of work at around
4 games of playing time. Any quarterback who has not attempted this many passes is
not included in our graphs. This narrowed our set of Valid Passers to 45 QBs, who
can be seen across every visualization.
</br></br>
In addition, for each visualization we compute the NFL Average. The average is computed using the 45 valid QBs.
</br></br>
Our work for this project can be found
<a href="https://github.com/AGupta15/INFO4310_MVP" target="_blank">here</a>,
which includes our data preprocessing and graph generation.

<p id="para">
  We begin by analyzing quarterback accuracy by the most obvious metric that can
   be understood by any viewer of the game: How well does the quarterback perform
   the further they throw the ball downfield? To break this metric down, we filtered
   each QB’s passes by pass distance downfield, measured as the distance travelled
   vertically down the field from the point of throw to the point it was either
   caught or hit the ground. Then, we bucketized passes into bins: passes that
   were less than 0 yards downfield (such as a pitch or a screen play)

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="A QB may throw the ball backwards to a teammate. </br>
      Because there will be no defenders behind the QB at </br>
      the start of a play, these are considered to be </br>
      relatively easy passes to complete."/>
    </svg>

    , 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40+ yards downfield. It is important to note
     that the majority of a QB’s throws will be under 30 yards, and as such all
     buckets under 30 yards will have a higher number of passes. To make this
     distribution visible, we place a “total pass attempts” datapoint on each
     completion percentage bar so it is clear how many passes were attempted in
     the computation of the completion percentage. It is important to note that
     a QB with 100% pass completion percentage and 2 total attempts and a QB with
     90% completion percentage with 20 total attempts should be compared with a
     grain of salt. Small sample sizes are subject to extremes. </p>

<p id="para">As with all of the graphs in our analysis, you can select the quarterbacks
   whom you are interested in analyzing using the dropdown key on the right of the graphic.<p>

<p id="para">For all of the MVP candidates, we list their completion percentages
  in the table below. We compute an “average ranking” metric in order to gauge
  how a quarterback rates across all categories against all other valid passers.
  We include Average Rank to help aid us to understand the ranking of a QB on
  aggregate, as a 2nd place rank in all categories is a much better performance
  than a single 1st place rank and five 8th place ranks. </p>

  important considering the volume of passes that are thrown in this range.
  As can be seen with most QBs on the chart, the highest number of passes
  that are thrown are between 0-10 yards, with the second most passes thrown
  from 10-20 yards. These passes aren’t as easy as passes behind the QB (< 0)
  as defenders clog up throwing lanes and force the QB to anticipate defenders
  actions. <p>

<p id="para">

  must not only be far downfield, but they must be accurate as receivers and

  or a big hit on the receiver. As seen in the graph, completion percentages
  significantly drop in these buckets due to their difficulty, yet Drew Brees
  easily takes 1st place in the latter 3 categories, beating the NFL average by
  more than 20% in some spots. It’s clear that Drew Brees is an accurate QB,
  something that NFL fans have been aware of for the better part of 2 decades;
  however this shows that Brees is accurate not only in the short game, but can complete
  throws downfield with accuracy rivaled by few in the league. On aggregate, Brees
  finishes 1st in Average Rank with 6.17 with Tom Brady giving a close chase at
  2nd place with a score of 10.5.

The purpose of looking at completion percentage vs down helps us understand how a QB performs in a micro-level pressure situation. Specifically, throughout the game, a team will face the 4 down count several times, as they progress through the football field. A QB who is more accurate on 3rd down or 4th down, in comparison to earlier downs, performs better when he has to make a play, and pressure is high. If the QB does not complete a pass in these situations, they may not lose the game, but they will either not score any points on that drive, or will settle for fewer points than a touchdown. As such, we look at these numbers for each QB. Note that sample size again matters, and as such a QB who attempts and completes 1 pass on 4th down would have 100% completion accuracy while a QB who attempts 2 passes but completes only 1 has a 50% accuracy. We do not want to reward QBs for having low attempts, and as such we enforce that a QB must have attempted at least 3 passes for each down to appear on the graph, otherwise we do not place a point on the graph for that down.

<p id="para">Using this metric, we see that there is a large spread for accuracy
  across downs. Tom Brady is efficient on 1st and 2nd down, but performs at the

  only had 1 attempt
  on 4th down this season, and thus we did not compute a percentage for him in
  this graph. Carson Wentz, the QB of the Champion Philadelphia Eagles, was
  constantly claimed to be the NFL MVP throughout the season, yet here we can
  see that his accuracy is subpar on 1st and 2nd down, falling to as much as
  6% below the NFL average. He does have better than average accuracy on 3rd and
  4th down, however, which alludes to the fact that he is accurate when it matters.
  The most dominant QB according to this metric, however, is Drew Brees of New Orleans.
  His completion percentage is the highest for every down, performing 10% more
  accurate than average on 1st down, 10.1% more accurate on 2nd down, 9.4% more
  accurate on 3rd down, and a whopping 30.6% more accurate on 4th down, only
  tied by Tom Brady. Brees has an average ranking of 3.25 across all downs and
  all qbs, which places him at #1. Tom Brady again comes in 2nd, with above
  average performances in each metric and only truly shining on 4th down.

<p id="para">Metric 3 provides a more macro-scale perspective on a QB’s performance. In Metric 2, we looked at how a QB performs based on a small scale situation in terms of the down of the current play. But how does a QB perform when the game is close? If the game is within 1 possession of tying or taking the lead, downs matter less because the game may be in the latter portion of the 4th quarter and URGENCY is key. Is a QB more accurate when the game is out of hand, or when the game is close and the QB cannot afford to make a mistake? We analyze a quarterback based on the score point spread at the time of a pass. Specifically, we look at the quarterbacks' team score less the defense team score (how much the QBs team is ahead or behind by) and analyze the completion percentage for each point spread up to 21 points. A positive point spread indicates that the QB’s team is ahead, and a negative point spread indicates they are behind. It is important to note that we do not include a data point if a QB has less than 3 passes for a bucket for the same reasons as graph 2. </br></br>

In order to use this graph, you can select QBs using the select picker below the graph, and adjust the scale of the graph by the point spread selector below it. For instance if you care about close games, you may select the +/- 7 point option, which will change the graph to only include passes with point spreads within this range.

When looking at our MVP candidates in this section, we see 2 major outcomes: Carson Wentz has subpar accuracy in comparison to his peers, consistently placing 3rd in almost every point differential. On the other hand, Drew Brees performs highly in many of the close point differentials, highly outplaying his peers in situations where his team is up by 1 through 6 points. Brady’s performance related to his peers is variable, with his accuracy staying roughly constant but his ranking varying from 1st to 3rd. From the looks of this graph, Brees again outplays his opponents and ranks the highest by this metric.

  Teams can also be evaluated by their success on drives. A team that is able to score more points quickly outperforms a team that has long drives with each scoring less points. As such, we look to evaluate QBs based on the quality of the drives they lead. In this graph we highlight the time per drive, yards per drive, points per drive, and plays per drive. Each of these metrics can help us see how quickly a team scores (time), how much progress a team makes on each offensive possession (yards), the impact the team has on the score (points), and the number of attempts a team takes on each possession (plays).
</p>

Our analysis finds that this metric provides insights only on the far extreme, showing QBs who severely hurt or help their team’s chance of winning. Particularly, the NFL average for win probability using the nflscrapR model sits at -1.5%, which at first glance would indicate that the average quarterback is a detriment to their team. When looking at the MVP candidates and their respective winning percentages, it appears that most of these QBs are “detrimental” to their team. Most of the QBs on this list are highly regarded in the NFL and in general do provide a lift to their team. In fact, the only QB with a positive win percentage difference is Carson Wentz, and even there he has only a 1.1% increase. We believe this is due to the fact that a good quarterback will always score points on his respective offensive drives. The more a team scores, the more the team has a chance to win. However, we calculate average win probability at the start of every play, and as such, any points scored by the offense will impact the win probability for the plays AFTER the team has scored. Therefore, a good quarterback’s defense is likely to have a higher win probability than when the QB is on the field.
</p>
<p id="para">
  We do find for the extreme cases we can find meaning in the change in win probability. The QB with the highest positive impact on his team is Jimmy Garoppolo of San Francisco, improving his team’s win probability by 17.7%. It was known that Jimmy G was a strong influence on his new team’s success at the end of the season, and this metric highlights that.  The QB with the largest negative impact on his team was Bryce Petty of the New York Jets, decreasing his team’s chances by a cringeworthy 18.9%. In the same manner as Jimmy G, Bryce Petty was known to be a horrendous quarterback; our graph statistic cements this sentiment and provides justification for the Jets recent decision to cut the signal caller.
</p>
<p id="para">
  Once again, this metric provides insight only to the deep extremes of the NFL, where poor performing teams are saved or average teams are severely hurt by their QBs. Our MVP candidates are difficult to analyze using this metric, and based on a simple (and somewhat irrelevant) comparison Carson Wentz ranks highest of the candidates.

  <div class="innerDiv">
  </br></br>
  <p id="para">Our analysis across all metrics shows that Tom Brady consistently performed well throughout the season. He was within the top 3 of many metrics, and placed 1st in different graphs. However, Drew Brees was the best performing QB of the set of MVP candidates. He performed 1st in accuracy by distance, accuracy by down, and 2nd in drive efficiency. Brady and Brees were clearly in a different league from the rest of the NFL, performing at a distinctly higher level than the rest of the QBs yet neck and neck with one another.
  </p>
  <p id="para">We note that of our MVP candidates, Carson Wentz did not come close to performing at the NFL MVP caliber level. Although he helped the Eagles go from a 7-9 team in 2016 to a 13-3 team in 2017, a large change in win percentage was not solely due to him, as seen by Philadelphia’s Super Bowl win despite his absence. Russell Wilson also performed average, yielding many double digit rankings.
  </p>
  <p id="para">We claim that <b>Drew Brees was the true NFL MVP</b> of the 2017 season. There are many reasons why we see that may explain why he did not win the award: The Patriots were the best team in their conference, if not the NFL, and as such Brady was accredited with more influence in their success. Furthermore, Brees has always been known for his passing prowess and the absurd numbers he puts up. However, this season saw his workload scale down with the rise of his running backs Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram. NFL viewers are used to seeing Brees do more than he did this past season, and as such it appeared that the team relied on him less when in fact he was even more effective at his lower workload. Considering the closeness of Brady and Brees by our analysis, we claim that deciding between these two quarterbacks would have been a tough decision and that either deserved the award.
