  <!--================================= INTRO ===============================-->
  <div class="no-bg">

  </br></br>
  <p id="para">
    Each NFL regular season, teams fight through a 16 game slate which pits them
    against their rivals across the league. The length of the season provides a
    large sample to truly distinguish the bad, good, and great teams. Yet it is
    always difficult to recognize who is most responsible for their team’s success.
    The NFL anoints a “Most Valuable Player” at the end of each season to honor the
    player who is perceived to have contributed the most to his team. In 2017, the
    New England Patriots finished with a league best 13-3 record, and their Quarterback
    Tom Brady was
    <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2757545-nfl-mvp-2017-18-award-winner-voting-results-and-twitter-reaction"
    >awarded</a>
    the MVP honor. This award is voted on by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award#Associated_Press_NFL_MVP_award"
    target="_blank">members of the media</a>.
    However, these members are subject to biases and each member’s vote may be
    influenced by personal opinion, group think or player exposure due to the
    market they play in (consider a player in a bigtime city like New York vs in
    Kansas City). Throughout the season, many players emerged as candidates for
    the MVP as their teams entered hot streaks, emphasizing the fact that the
    team might be the more responsible for the award versus the player themselves.
    Therefore, we pose the question: <b>Did Tom Brady deserve the 2017 NFL MVP?</b>
  </p>
  <p id="para">
    To answer this question, we defined metrics that aim to analyze a player’s
    contribution to his team. We use our metrics to statistically break down a
    set of quarterbacks who we consider MVP candidates from the 2017 NFL Season.
    It is important to note that we selected metrics for analysis <i>before</i>
    looking at the dataset to reduce any biases we may exhibit. Furthermore, we
    make this analysis available to <i>you</i>, the reader, through interactive
    graphs that allow you to perform your own analysis. In each section, we will
    explain our methodology, including how we processed the data. Finally, for
    those who are not as familiar with football but are fans of numerical arguments,
    we will provide notes like this

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="This is an example note"/>
    </svg>

    to supplement
    your knowledge of football as you read.
  </br></br>
  </p>

  <h1 id="h1-section">MVP Candidates</h1></br>
  <p id="para"> Our set of NFL MVP candidates only includes quarterbacks (QBs).
    This is because QBs inherently have more value in today’s NFL as passing has
    taken over offensive play calling.

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="An in-depth data visualization post on how NFL offenses have changed
      <a href='https://www.besttickets.com/blog/evolution-of-nfl-offense/'
      target='_blank'>over time</a>"/>
    </svg>

    .
    Quarterbacks touch the ball on every play and make the most important
    decisions that influence his team’s success, such as audibles

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="An audible is when the QB changes the play the offense will run.</br>
      This may be because there are better matchups for the offense </br> based on how
      the defense is aligned."/>
    </svg>

    , checking the
    defense and modifying the play

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="More in depth than an audible, a QB may change the responsibility </br>
      of a specific player on the field without changing the play."/>
    </svg>

    , and getting the ball from the center to the
    running back or receiver

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="At the start of every play, the ball is snapped </br>
      from the center to the QB. The QB is responsible </br> for
      either handing the ball to the running back </br>
      or throwing it to a receiver."/>
    </svg>

    . Furthermore, 22.5 of the last 30 MVP Awards have
    gone to QBs (0.5 being attributed to Co-MVPs). Although fans of LA Rams
    Running Back Todd Gurley may take issue with our exclusion of RBs

    <svg class="infoSVG">
      <image
      xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
      alt="Todd Gurley is a Running Back for the Los Angeles</br> Rams.
      Gurley also received votes for the MVP in 2017."/>
    </svg>

    , in order to complete a fair assessment of Brady, we must compare him using
    metrics relevant to Brady, and as such, we can only compare him against QBs.
    Our NFL MVP candidate set includes 6 QBs who were selected to the Pro Bowl
    this past season.

  </br></br>
  1. Tom Brady, NE</br>
  2. Carson Wentz, PHI</br>
  3. Roethlisberger, PIT</br>
  4. Philip Rivers, LAC</br>
  5. Russell Wilson, SEA</br>
  6. Drew Brees, NO</br>
</br>
</p>
<h1 id="h1-section">Metrics of Analysis</h1></br>

<p id="para">
We will compare Brady to each of the other 5 QBs and gauge his value on 3 metrics:
</p>

<p id="para">
  <b>1. Passing Effectiveness</b>
</p>

<p id="para">
This dimension analyzes QB accuracy by completion percentage. We break down effectiveness
into accuracy by pass distance, down

  alt="Each team must advance the ball 10 yards from their </br>
  starting point within 4 tries to keep the ball. Each of</br>

</svg>

, and a game’s point spread. Each of these graphs highlight a QB’s ability to
perform based on pass difficulty (distance), short-term difficulty (down), and
long-term pressure (point spread).
<p id="para"><b>2. Efficiency</b></p>

<p id="para">We gauge a QB’s efficiency based on a series of drive metrics, which
  includes time per drive

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"

</svg>

 he plays in by looking at scoring (points per drive), speed (time per drive),
 length (yards per drive), and rate of progress (plays per drive).
</p>

<p id="para"><b>3. Impact</b></p>
<p id="para">A player’s value can also be quantified by looking at his impact on
  his team’s win probability.

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image

  alt="Win probability is computed by the models at nflscrapR-data."/>
</svg>

By comparing offense and defense average win probability (WPA), the change from
defense WPA to offense WPA may indicate how much that given player impacts their
team.
</p>

<h1 id="h1-section">Methodology</h1></br>
<p id="para">
To compute our metrics for analysis, we rely on the
<a href="https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data" target="_blank">nflscrapR-data</a>
dataset, which contains a play by play documentation across the 2017 NFL Season.
The author originally scraped all the data from the
<a href="https://api.nfl.com/docs/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">NFL API</a>
and joined many datasets together to form this one.</br></br>

We filter the quarterbacks we compare in our visualizations by their total number
of passes across the 2017 NFL Season. A QB is included if they have attempted at
least 100 passes, as this provides a reasonable body of work at around 4 games
of playing time. Any quarterback who has not attempted this many passes is not
included in our graphs. This narrowed our set of Valid Passers to 45 QBs, who
can be seen across every visualization. In addition, for each visualization we
compute the NFL Average using the 45 valid QBs.
</br></br>
Our work for this project can be found
<a href="https://github.com/AGupta15/INFO4310_MVP" target="_blank">here</a>,
which includes our data preprocessing and graph generation.

  <div class="innerDiv">
  </br></br>
  <h3 id="h3-title">Metric 1: Quarterback Accuracy by Pass Distance</h3>
  </br>
  <p id="para">
    We begin by analyzing the most obvious metric to any viewer of the game: How
    accurate is a quarterback the further they throw the ball downfield? To break
    this metric down, we filtered each QB’s passes by pass distance, measured as
    the vertical distance travelled downfield from the point of throw to where it
    was caught or hit the ground. Then, we sorted passes into bins: passes that
    were less than 0 yards downfield (such as a pitch or a screen play)

      <svg class="infoSVG">
        <image
        xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
        alt="A QB may throw the ball backwards to a teammate. </br>
        Because there will be no defenders behind the QB at </br>
        the start of a play, these are considered to be </br>
        relatively easy passes to complete."/>
      </svg>

      , 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40+ yards downfield. It is important to
      note that the majority of throws are under 30 yards, and thus all buckets
      under 30 yards will have a higher number of passes. To make this distribution
      visible, we place a “total pass attempts” datapoint on each completion
      percentage bar so it is clear how many passes were attempted in the
      computation of the completion percentage. Consider the example of a QB
      with 100% pass completion percentage and 2 total attempts and a QB with
      90% completion percentage with 20 total attempts. The comparison between
      these two QBs should be taken with a grain of salt as small sample sizes
      are subject to extremes. </p>

  For all MVP candidates, we list completion percentages in the table below. We
  compute an “average ranking” metric to gauge how a quarterback rates across all
  categories against all other valid passers. We include Average Rank to aid our
  understanding of a QB’s aggregate ranking, as a 2nd place rank in all categories
  is a much better performance than a single 1st place rank and five 8th place ranks.

  As can be seen with most QBs on the chart, the highest number of passes
  that are thrown are between 0-10 yards, with the second most passes thrown
  from 10-20 yards. These passes aren’t as easy as passes behind the QB (< 0)

  have distance and accuracy, especially considering receivers and defenders alike
  have great catching skills

  or a big hit on the receiver. As seen in the graph, completion percentages
  significantly drop in these buckets due to their difficulty, yet Drew Brees
  easily takes 1st place in the latter 3 categories, beating the NFL average by
  more than 20% in some spots. Drew Brees is clearly an accurate QB, something
  that NFL fans have been known for the better part of 2 decades; however this
  shows that Brees is accurate not only in the short game, but can complete
  throws downfield with accuracy rivaled by few in the league. On aggregate,
  Brees finishes 1st in Average Rank with 6.17 with Tom Brady giving close
  chase at 2nd place with a score of 10.5.

<h3 id="h3-title">Metric 2: Quarterback Accuracy by Passing Down</h3>
</br>
<p id="para">
Completion percentage per down helps us understand how a QB performs in a
micro-level pressure situation. Specifically, throughout the game, a team will
face the 4 down count many times as they progress through the football field.
QBs who are more accurate on 1st or 2nd down will likely be advancing the ball
forward more often, facing fewer 3rd and 4th downs

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Every time a team gains 10 yards, the down count is </br>
  reset to 1, and again have 4 downs to get 10 yards."/>
</svg>


. Alternatively, a QB who is
more accurate on 3rd down or 4th down, in comparison to earlier downs, performs
better when he has to make a play, and pressure is high. If the QB does not
complete a pass in these situations, they may not lose the game, but they will
either not score any points on that drive, or will settle for fewer points than
a touchdown

<svg class="infoSVG">
  <image
  xlink:href="img/info-button.png"
  alt="Drives can end several ways. The team may </br>
  score a touchdown, kick a field goal, get </br>
  intercepted, fumble the ball, or turn the </br>
  ball over on downs. To prevent the latter, </br>
  teams can punt (kick) the ball away on 4th down </br>
  to force the other team to have to go further </br>
  to score."/>
</svg>


. Note that sample size again matters, and a QB who attempts and
completes 1 pass on 4th down would have 100% completion accuracy while a QB who
attempts 2 passes but completes only 1 has a 50% accuracy. We do not want to
reward QBs for having low attempts, and thus we enforce that a QB must have
attempted at least 3 passes for each down to appear on the graph, otherwise we
do not place a point on the graph for that down.

   percentage for him in this graph. Carson Wentz, the QB of the champion
   Philadelphia Eagles, was constantly claimed to be the NFL MVP throughout the
   season, yet here we can see that his accuracy is subpar on 1st and 2nd down,
   falling to as much as 6% below the NFL average. He does have better than
   average accuracy on 3rd and 4th down, however, which alludes to the fact that
   he is accurate when it matters. The most dominant QB according to this metric,
   however, is Drew Brees. His completion percentage is the highest for every down,
   performing 10% more accurate than average on 1st down, 10.1% more accurate on
   2nd down, 9.4% more accurate on 3rd down, and a whopping 30.6% more accurate
   on 4th down, tied only by Tom Brady. Brees has an average ranking of 3.25 across
   all downs and all qbs, which places him at #1. Tom Brady again comes in 2nd,
   with above average performances in each metric and only truly shining on 4th down.

  <h3 id="h3-title">Metric 3: Quarterback Accuracy by Point Spread</h3>
</br>
  <p id="para">
    Metric 3 provides a macro-scale perspective on a QB’s performance. In Metric
    2, we looked at how a QB performs based on a small scale situation in terms
    of the down of the current play. But how does a QB perform when the game is
    close? If the game is within 1 possession of tying or taking the lead, downs
    matter less because the game may be in the latter portion of the 4th quarter
    and urgency is key. Is a QB more accurate when the game is out of hand, or
    when the game is close and the QB cannot afford to make a mistake? We analyze
    a quarterback based on the score point spread at the time of a pass. Specifically,
    we look at a QB's team score less the defense team score (how much the QBs
    team is ahead or behind by) and analyze the completion percentage for each
    point spread up to 21 points. A positive point spread indicates that the QB’s
    team is ahead, and a negative point spread indicates they are behind. We do not
    include a data point if a QB has less than 3 passes for a bucket for the same
    reasons as graph 2.
  </p>
  <p id="para">
  In order to use this graph, you can select QBs using the select picker below
  the graph, and adjust the scale of the graph by the point spread selector below
  it. For instance, to analyze close games, you may select the +/- 7 point option,
  which will change the graph to only include passes with point spreads within this range.

    Of course, this breakdown is a bit difficult to digest in its entirety. To
    simplify our comparison, we compute the QB accuracy by point spread bins,
    considering tie games (0 pts), 1 possession games (1-7 pts), 2 possession
    games (8-14 pts), 3 possession games (15-21 pts), and blowouts (22 pts+).
    We again compute an average ranking metric, but it is much clearer that a
    QB’s accuracy is much more important in a tie game than in one where his
    team is up by 17. Therefore we only compute the average ranking looking at
    games within reach, which we define as the first three buckets (0-14 points).

Interestingly, this metric provides many valuable insights on each QB’s
performances. First, Drew Brees is very effective in close games. His accuracy
of 73.2% of one possession games and 68.8% in two possession games leads the
league. In tie games, Brees also performs well, at 9.1% above the NFL average.
Even in blowouts, Brees performs at an absurd 86.7% accuracy, placing him at the
top of our MVP list for this metric. Tom Brady is the most accurate in tie games
at 72.5%, but regresses in most other buckets. He still plays at a 2nd place rate
for games within one possession, but plays at roughly an average level for games
within 2 possessions.
</p>
<p id="para">
  More telling, this metric shows us that Brees and Brady are in their own
  league compared to other “top” QBs in the league. Rivers, Wentz, and Wilson
  all play at average or below average levels for nearly every metric, with
  rankings far below MVP standards. Looking at Wentz, his performance is average
  for games tied or within one possession, but falls below league average for
  all other situations. Russell Wilson performs even more horridly, playing at a
  -9.0% completion percentage to league average for tied games, not a performance
  you’d want from an MVP candidate. Wilson provides an interesting example where
  his performance skyrockets for games between 15 and 21 points, as he has a near
  100% completion rate, but is otherwise below average.

  per drive, and plays per drive. Each of these metrics can help us see how quickly
  a team scores (time), how much progress a team makes on each offensive possession
  (yards), the impact the team has on the score (points), and the number of attempts
  a team takes on each possession (plays).

Our analysis finds that this metric provides insights only on the extreme performers,
showing QBs who severely hurt or help their team’s chance of winning. Particularly,
the NFL average for win probability using the nflscrapR model sits at -1.5%, which
at first glance would indicate that the average quarterback is a detriment to their team.
When looking at the MVP candidates and their respective winning percentages, it appears
that many QBs are “detrimental” to their team. Most of the QBs on this list are
highly regarded in the NFL and in general do provide a lift to their team. In fact, the
only QB with a positive win percentage difference is Carson Wentz, and even
he has only a 1.1% increase. We believe this is due to the fact that a good quarterback
will always score points on his respective offensive drives. The more a team scores,
the more the team has a chance to win. However, we calculate average win probability
at the start of every play, and as such, any points scored by the offense will
impact the win probability for the plays AFTER the team has scored. Therefore, a
good quarterback’s defense is likely to have a higher win probability than when
the QB is on the field.

  , improving his team’s win probability by 17.7%. It
  was known that Jimmy G was a strong influence on his new team’s success at the
  end of the season, and this metric highlights that.  The QB with the largest
  negative impact on his team was Bryce Petty of the New York Jets

  , decreasing
  his team’s chances by a cringeworthy 18.9%. In the same manner as Jimmy G,
  Bryce Petty was known to be a horrendous quarterback; our graph statistic
  cements this sentiment and provides justification for the Jets recent decision
  to cut the signal caller.

  Once again, this metric provides insight only to the deep extremes of the NFL,
  where poor performing teams are saved or average teams are severely hurt by their QBs.
  Our MVP candidates are difficult to analyze using this metric, and based on a simple
  (and somewhat irrelevant) comparison Carson Wentz ranks highest of the candidates.

  <p id="para">Our analysis across all metrics shows that Tom Brady consistently
    performed well throughout the season. He was within the top 3 of many metrics,
    and placed 1st in different graphs. However, Drew Brees was the best performing
    QB of the set of MVP candidates. He performed 1st in accuracy by distance,
    accuracy by down, and 2nd in drive efficiency. Brady and Brees were clearly
    in a different league from the rest of the NFL, performing at a distinctly
    higher level than the rest of the QBs yet neck and neck with one another.
  </p>
  <p id="para">We note that of our MVP candidates, Carson Wentz did not come close
    to performing at the NFL MVP caliber level. Although he helped the Eagles go
    from a 7-9 team in 2016 to a 13-3 team in 2017, a large change in win percentage
    was not solely due to him, as seen by Philadelphia’s Super Bowl win despite
    his absence. Russell Wilson also performed average, yielding many double digit rankings.
  </p>
  <p id="para">
    When making a purely statistical argument, it is clear that <b>Drew Brees was
      the true NFL MVP</b> of the 2017 season. However, as mentioned before, the
      MVP is not awarded solely based on data, and we hypothesize some more political
      reasons why Drew Brees did not win the award: The Patriots were the best
      team in their conference, if not the NFL, and as such Brady was accredited
      with more influence in their success. Furthermore, Brees has always been
      known for his passing prowess and his absurd consistency in setting passing
      records. However, this season saw his workload scale down with the rise of
      his running backs, Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram. NFL viewers are used to
      seeing Brees do more than he did this past season, and as such it appeared
      that the team relied on him less when in fact he might may have been even
      more effective at his lower workload.
  </p>
  <p id="para">
    The fact that Drew Brees’ dominance was left unnoticed brings into question
    the current structure of the MVP voting system. Instead of choosing the players
    who perform the best, the award tends to gravitate towards the players who are
    “newest” to the scene, considering the candidacy of Carson Wentz who performed
    below several QBs according to our metrics. By allowing media members to vote
    for the MVP award, we allow for human biases to interfere with purely numerical
    arguments for or against a player. Sentiment does not win arguments, but
    numbers do. And it is for this reason that we call for the NFL MVP voting
    system to be changed. We propose that the NFL choose 3 metrics that correlate
    with player impact as we have done in this article and allow for the rankings
    according to these metrics account for 25% or more of the voting weight. It is
    only through integration with numbers that we can truly award the Most
    Valuable Player the MVP award.
